## üìã Setup Steps (Railway)

### 1. Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Use GitHub OAuth for easy access

### 2. Create New Project
```bash
# Railway will auto-detect railway.json
```

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Service
```
Dashboard ‚Üí New ‚Üí Database ‚Üí PostgreSQL
```

### 4. Get Database URL
```bash
# Railway provides this automatically as DATABASE_URL
# Connect your app service to database service
```

### 5. Set Environment Variables
Add these in Railway dashboard:
```env
# Shopify (from your .env.local)
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_secret
SCOPES=read_products,write_discounts,etc
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Database (auto-provided by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Node
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 6. Deploy
```bash
# Railway auto-deploys on git push to main
git push origin main
```

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### Option 1: Railway ($5/month)
- App hosting: Included
- Database: Included (1GB)
- **Total: $5/month** after free credit
- Notification: $5-$10/month after scaling

### Option 2: Render.com (FREE with limitations)
‚ùå **Not recommended for Shopify apps**
- Free tier spins down after inactivity
- Webhooks will fail
- No PostgreSQL on free tier
- **Would need: App ($7/month) + DB ($7/month) = $14/month**

### Option 3: Fly.io
- Free tier available but complex
- Need separate database (~$3-5/month)
- More setup required
- **Total: ~$3-5/month**

### Option 4: Supabase + Any host
- Supabase PostgreSQL: FREE (generous limits)
- Vercel/Railway: FREE tier
- **Total: $0** but complex setup
- Issues: Supabase is client-focused, not ideal for server apps

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**Use Railway.app - $5/month**

Why it wins:
1. Already configured (`railway.json` exists)
2. Simplest setup (database included)
3. Reliable for production
4. Best for Shopify apps (always-on)
5. Cost-effective for what you get

**Alternative if $5 is too much:**
Use Supabase (free PostgreSQL) + Fly.io (free hosting)
- More work to set up
- Slightly less reliable
- Free initially, then ~$3/month later
