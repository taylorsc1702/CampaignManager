## 🔄 What's Left

### Components to Update
These still have 'use client' and need API integration:
- LinkCreator - Needs to call `/api/links/create`
- BulkLinkCreator - Bulk operations
- Other utility components

### Options:

**A. Convert All Components Now**
- Remove all 'use client' 
- Make them call API routes
- Fully server-side architecture
- **Time:** 1-2 hours

**B. Keep Functional (Recommended for Now)**
- LinkCreator already calls `/api/products/lookup` ✅
- Need to update it to call `/api/links/create` 
- Works but client-side
- **Time:** 30 minutes

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Option B - Update LinkCreator to use new API**

It already has the structure to call APIs. Just need to:
1. Update `/api/links/create-from-url` call to `/api/links/create`
2. Update the product creation logic to use the API

This gives you a working app faster, then you can refactor later.
