# Critical Fixes Needed for Railway + Supabase

## ðŸ”´ Immediate Issues

### 1. Components Use 'use client' (Next.js Pattern)
**All components** have `'use client'` directive - this won't work in React Router
- Remove from all 8 components
- Convert to server-loaded components

### 2. Supabase Configuration Wrong
**File:** `app/lib/supabase.ts`
**Issues:**
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (Next.js pattern)
- Creates client-side instances
- Need server-side service role client for React Router

### 3. No Server-Side Data Loading
**Routes don't pass merchant data** - components use hardcoded demo data
- Need loaders to fetch merchant from Supabase
- Need to pass shop data from Shopify session

### 4. Shopify Session Not Connected to Supabase
- When app installs, need to create/update merchant record
- Currently no connection between Shopify sessions and Supabase merchants

### 5. Missing Environment Variables
Need proper env var names for React Router (not Next.js)
